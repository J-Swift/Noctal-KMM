I&#x27;ve been working professionally for ~7 years building mostly javascript projects but also some PHP. Two years ago I was diagnosed with a condition called &quot;Usher&#x27;s Syndrome&quot; - characterized by hearing loss, balance issues, and progressive vision loss.<p>I know there are blind software engineers out there. My main questions are:<p>- Are there blind frontend engineers?<p>- What kinds of software engineering lend themselves to someone with limited vision? Backend only?<p>- Besides a screen reader, what are some of the best tools for building software with limited vision?<p>- Does your company employ blind engineers? How well does it work? What kind of engineer are they?<p>I&#x27;m really trying to get ahead of this thing and prepare myself as my vision is degrading rather quickly. I&#x27;m not sure what I can do if I can&#x27;t do SE as I don&#x27;t have any formal education in anything. I&#x27;ve worked really hard to get to where I am and don&#x27;t want it to go to waste.<p>Thank you for any input, and stay safe out there!<p>Edit:<p>Thank you all for your links, suggestions, and moral support, I really appreciate it. Since my diagnosis I&#x27;ve slowly developed a crippling anxiety centered around a feeling that I need to figure out the rest of my life before it&#x27;s too late. I know I shouldn&#x27;t think this way but it is hard not to. I&#x27;m very independent and I feel a pressure to &quot;show up.&quot; I will look into these opportunities mentioned and try to get in touch with some more members of the blind engineering community."
